# JobtrackerBackend

Backend for a job tracker application, designed to keep track of your job applications and their states in the hiring process.  
This backend connects your .NET MAUI frontend to a Supabase instance for data storage and authentication.  
Authentication is handled via JWT Bearer tokens.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- JWT Bearer authentication validated against Supabase.
- CRUD endpoints for managing job applications.
- Supports file uploads (CV, application files) to Supabase Storage buckets.
- Organized data models and DTOs.
- Ready for local Docker or .NET CLI development.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- ASP.NET Core 9 Web API
- Supabase .NET SDK
- JWT Bearer Authentication
- Entity Framework Core & PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- Docker for containerization

## üöÄ Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/woidthevoid/JobtrackerBackend.git
cd JobtrackerBackend
```

### 2. Configure Supabase keys

Edit JobtrackerBackend/appsettings.Development.json with your Supabase credentials:
```JSON
{
  "Supabase": {
    "Url": "https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co",
    "Key": "your-anon-or-service-role-key",
    "ServiceRoleKey": "your-service-role-secret-key"
  }
}
```
### 3. Restore dependencies and run (using .NET CLI)
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run --project JobtrackerBackend
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:5050.

### 4. Run with Docker
Build and start the API with Docker:
```bash
cd JobtrackerBackend
docker build -t jobtracker-backend .
docker run --env-file ../JobtrackerBackend/appsettings.Development.json -p 5050:5050 jobtracker-backend
```
Or, using Compose (from project root):
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## üîí Authentication
- All endpoints require a JWT Bearer token in the Authorization header.
- Token must be issued by your Supabase project and have the correct audience (authenticated).
- Example:
```Code
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Unauthorized/forbidden requests return HTTP 401/403.
